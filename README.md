USB AVR programmer PCB and firmware files. There is Eagle PCB files for two versions: One with 5V target voltage only, other with selectable 3.3V and 5V target supply voltage. There is also a single side PCB layout image, which is meant for homemade PCB making.


For flashing the firmware, use another AVR ISP programmer connected to the ISP socket. Read the instruction in the firmware folder.
